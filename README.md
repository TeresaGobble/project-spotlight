Project Spotlight is a **crime tracking and visualization application** that allows the public to search Chicago city crime data by offense and location. The primary intended use of this project is to provide an avenue for those who wish to find the safest streets to commute through, live in, or visit. Our data, which is updated daily, can additionally be used for research, personal, or educational purposes!

*All data is provided by the City of Chicago and published at:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present-Dashboard/5cd6-ry5g*
